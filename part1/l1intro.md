## Typescript
> Typescript is a programming language developed by Microsoft.

### We can gain advantage
1. Type Safety (Statically typed feature)
2. Error Detection

### Early Error Detection
Typescript catches errors at compile time. This help prevent runtime errors and make your code mode reliable.

### Improved Readability & Maintainability
Easier to read and understand. Other developers can quickly understand as well.

- Javascript is small-scale applications.
- Typescript is medium-large applications.
- Typescript can use for client-side as Reactjs & Angularjs like javascript
- Typescript can use for Server-Side with Nodejs like javascript

### Javascript Vs Typescript
#### Typescript
1. Static programming Language
2. Compiled language (tsc compiler)
3. Compilation Errors
4. Browser can't run directly

#### Javascript
1. Dynamic programming language
2. Interpreted
3. Runtime Errors
4. Browser can run directly
